3. Hello, my name is Sergey.


 **I am 47 years old, and I believe that self-development has no age.**

I'm learning to code just a few months. I am sure that learning something new can change my life.I will be able to turn my ideas into reality and give pleasure not only to people, but first of all to myself.

Prove to everyone that the dream job exists and age is not a hindrance

>Don't leave a stone unturned. It's always something, to know you have done the most you could.

5. Code example:
`function reverseStr(str) {
    let newStr = '', i;
    for (i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        newStr += str.charAt(i);
    }
    return newStr;
}

    function isPalindrome(line) {
        return line == line.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
          }`
